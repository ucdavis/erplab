This is not commercial software,  and bugs can happen #
In some cases,  errors will occur leading to a message that #
instructs you to report the error to the EEGLAB developers. #
If this happens, please report the error to erplabtoolbox@gmail.com #
and not to the EEGLAB developers. ERPLAB has primarily been #
tested using EEG collected with a Biosemi ActiveTwo System, #
along with a smaller amount of testing using EEG collected #
with Neuroscan and EGI systems. Consequently, you should be #
particularly careful when using this version of ERPLAB with #
data collected with systems other than the Biosemi ActiveTwo. #
